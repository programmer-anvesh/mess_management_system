# mess_management_system
A hostel mess operates and serves a number of meals during the day to the students residing in the hostel. The current system being followed requires that each student pay a fixed mess fee at the beginning of the year. In the case when a student is not eating in the mess, he can take a mess off and the fee for those days will be waived. However this is a problem if we consider the fact that a studentâ€™s absence from the mess may not be continuous but scattered for eg he may eat in the mess for two days then not eat the next day,then again eat for three days, then not eat for the next two days etc. In this case, it would be very cumbersome for a student to get a mess off for each absence. This problem is prevalent in all the hostels across our institute and in such cases, the students do not even bother to get a mess off whenever they are absent from the mess.
